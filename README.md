# Migrate (migrate10000.appspot.com)

How many times have you Ubered or Lyfted from campus to your nearest airport? And how many of those times were you alone? Every school break, thousands of college kids flock to the airports at the same time. But they don't know who else to share Uber or Lyft rides with.

This web app resolves the problem by matching users with similar flight times, so that they can coordinate Ubering or Lyfting together to the airport, or wherever. This can reduce the cost by more than half for each person!

Step 1. Give Your Travel Plans Provide Migrate with the day you plan to fly out of an airport near campus, as well as the earliest and latest times in the day you can leave.

Step 2. Merge and Coordinate! Migrate will alert you whenever another student has an overlapping shared ride with you. When at most 6 people match, a groupchat will start and you can take it from there!

This app was built using Google Cloud Platform and Facebook API.
